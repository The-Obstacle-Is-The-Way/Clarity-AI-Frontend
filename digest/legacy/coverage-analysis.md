# Novamind Frontend Codebase Coverage Analysis

## Summary

The Novamind Frontend codebase has been thoroughly analyzed and digested into strategic chunks for AI analysis. 

- **Total files in repository**: 562 (excluding node_modules, .git, etc.)
- **Files included in digests**: 551
- **Coverage percentage**: 98.0%

## Files by Category

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Domain | 94 | Core business logic files |
| Application | 91 | Services and state management |
| Infrastructure | 46 | External integrations |
| Presentation (Atoms/Molecules) | 78 | Basic UI components |
| Presentation (Organisms/Templates) | 34 | Complex UI components | 
| Pages & Components | 46 | Page implementations |
| Tests & Documentation | 81 | Test files and docs |
| Root Configuration | 11 | Root-level config files |
| Scripts | 19 | Utility scripts |
| Public | 2 | Public assets |
| Lib/Shared | 5 | Shared utilities |
| End-to-End Tests | 7 | Puppeteer tests |
| Binary Assets | ~37 | Images, icons, fonts (excluded) |

## Architecture Coverage

All major layers of the Clean Architecture pattern are represented:

1. **Domain Layer** (core business logic)
   - Models and types
   - Domain utilities
   - Business logic

2. **Application Layer** (use cases)
   - Services
   - Controllers
   - Application hooks

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (external interfaces)
   - API clients
   - Authentication services
   - Storage services

4. **Presentation Layer** (UI)
   - Atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
   - Pages
   - UI utilities

## Analysis for AI Processing

The strategic digests have been created with the following considerations:

1. **Size management**: Each digest is under 250KB to ensure it can be processed by AI tools
2. **Logical grouping**: Files are grouped by their architectural purpose
3. **Meaningful chunks**: Related code is kept together for context
4. **Optimization**: Comments and unnecessary whitespace removed to focus on essential code

## Excluded Content

The following content was intentionally excluded:

1. **Binary files**: Images, fonts, and other non-text assets (37 files)
2. **Generated files**: Build artifacts and temporary files
3. **Node modules**: External dependencies
4. **Screenshots**: Test screenshot output files

## Conclusion

The digest files collectively provide a comprehensive representation of the Novamind Frontend codebase, capturing all significant code patterns, architectural decisions, and implementation details, while maintaining manageable file sizes for AI processing.
