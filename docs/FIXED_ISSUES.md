# Fixed Issues Summary

## Completed Fixes

1. **RegionSelectionIndicator.tsx**: 
   - Verified that lowercase `<sphereGeometry>` is correct according to React Three Fiber conventions
   - Confirmed with codebase patterns that this is the proper approach
   - No change was needed as the original code was correct

2. **PatientDetailCard.tsx**:
   - Fixed invalid DOM nesting issue by changing inner `<div>` to `<span>` inside the DetailItem component
   - This resolves the accessibility anti-pattern where `<div>` elements were nested inside `<p>` tags
   - The fix maintains the same visual appearance while improving accessibility

3. **ThemeProvider.enhanced.test.tsx**:
   - Attempted to fix the skipped test for localStorage theme persistence
   - Added better cleanup before test execution
   - Used longer timeouts for waitFor to handle timing issues
   - This test may need further refinement based on how it runs in CI

4. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Created `docs/SKIPPED_TESTS.md` with comprehensive documentation on skipped tests
   - Improved code comments in `BrainModelVisualization.test.tsx` to explain why tests are skipped
   - Added detailed guidance on alternative testing approaches

## Remaining Work

1. **AuthService.enhanced.test.ts Tests**:
   - The 13 skipped tests in this file require a more fundamental approach
   - Create a specialized test harness with proper mocking
   - Consider refactoring the AuthService class to be more testable
   - Address TypeScript errors with localStorage mocking

2. **Linter Errors in Test Files**:
   - Several test files have linter errors related to unused imports and whitespace
   - These should be addressed systematically across the codebase

3. **Three.js Component Testing Strategy**:
   - Implement the multi-layered testing approach described in the documentation
   - Create Storybook/Ladle stories for visual testing
   - Set up E2E tests for critical visualization features

## Recommendations for Test Infrastructure

1. **Create Test Utilities**:
   - Build specialized utilities for mocking browser APIs like localStorage
   - Create helpers for testing asynchronous state changes
   - Develop wrappers for Three.js component testing

2. **Improve Test Coverage Reporting**:
   - Configure test coverage to ignore intentionally skipped tests
   - Add documentation comments to explain coverage gaps
   - Create a dashboard for tracking test coverage improvements

3. **Continuous Integration Improvements**:
   - Ensure CI pipeline correctly handles skipped tests
   - Add visual regression testing for 3D components
   - Implement performance benchmarking for critical components

## Timeline Recommendation

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Complete fixes for remaining linter errors
   - Add explicit documentation to all skipped tests
   - Create test plan for addressing high-priority test gaps

2. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Implement test utilities and helpers
   - Fix ThemeProvider test to be more reliable
   - Start building Storybook stories for 3D components

3. **Long-term (1-2 months)**:
   - Refactor AuthService for better testability
   - Implement E2E testing for critical visualization features
   - Achieve 90%+ test coverage for non-3D components
